Glitched Worlds SMB1 Patch
==========================

This patch adds a world select menu when starting SMB1.

Usage:
 - Press select to switch between lines
 - Press Left or Right to change values by 1, Up or Down to change by 16
 - Press Start to start the game!
 - Press A+Start to play in hard more, B+Start to play with two players.

A couple of things to be aware of:
 - The selectors are 0-based, so if you pick world 0, area 0, you will get what's normally 1-1 (the title screen will show 1-1.) This was done to make it easier to remember level numbers rather than having to remember that you were on "right side of a cloud - copyright sign"
 
 - The 'area' selector picks areas not levels. If you play a stage where there's a pipe entry cutscene, it is it's own separate area. This way you can access every single area but the numbering can be a little off.

Download & Installation
=======================

First, download the latest patch from the [releases](https://github.com/threecreepio/smb-glitchedworlds/releases)

Then apply that IPS (using for instance Lunar IPS or http://rainwarrior.ca/projects/nes/ips.html) to the original, unmodified version of the Super Mario Bros. (US/World) ROM. 

The MD5 checksum for the ROM you should be using is `811b027eaf99c2def7b933c5208636de`.

Have fun!

Game Genie Codes
================

Some of the glitched levels behave kind of strange, and you might need game genie codes to get a good look at them. Here are some useful ones:

- `YZNLLYTX` - Disables the "TIME UP" message, so your game timer can't expire.

- `AANLIAAL` - Allows control of Mario when he's stuck at the top of the level.

- `AISSONOX` - Allows moving through walls

- `EYSPAPEI` - Turn ground levels into water levels, and water levels into ground levels.

- `NYNPKGYE` - Disable automatic right movement (this will break actual cutscene levels)
